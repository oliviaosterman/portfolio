This is a personal project I made for fun. When forcing myself to learn python, I wanted to make something I was interested in and actually use. I love animal crossing and wanted a way to find out exactly what I could do for fishing right now. I made this quick little project to tell me what fish I need to finish my museum, when I can catch those fish, what fish I can catch right now, and more.
